# Dell Optiplex temperature and fan control
Many of Dell Optiplex has no way of controlling fan speed in certain distros of Linux. This is a good enough work around.
Fancontrol and/or i8kmon isn't a sure way of making sure that the fans aren't dead or at full blast. This is a crude solve.

How-to:

```
apt install i8kutils lm-sensors acpi
```

edit ```/etc/modules``` to contain:
```
coretemp
i8k
dell-smm-hwmon
```

edit ```/etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf``` to contain:
```
options i8k force=1
```

reboot

Move tempcontrol.sh to ```/usr/local/bin/``` and make sure it's executable (chmod +x)
Move tempcontrol.service to ```/etc/systemd/system/```

```
systemctl enable tempcontrol.service
systemctl start tempcontrol.service
```

Check status with ```systemctl status tempcontrol.service```
Check sensors to make sure that fan speed and temperature is showing correctly

# For some reason you can trick Fancontrol to work on some versions of the Optiplex family

Keep ```/etc/modules``` as above

Don't use the i8k config but instead add this to /etc/modprobe.d/dell-smm-hwmon
```
options dell-smm-hwmon ignore_dmi=1
```

Run ```sensors-detect``` and then ```pwmconfig``` and if you're lucky you have a functioning fancontrol

Reboot
